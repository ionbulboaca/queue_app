Hello i implemented this mini app using PHP and Javascript, AJAX, Bootstrap and MySql as database. I developed without any framework because like this was prefered :).

To work need this configuration:
1)Mysql version >=5.5:
  a)Database name:queue_app;
  b)Database user:root;
  c)Database password:ionel123(can be changed);
  d)Database host:127.0.0.1(localhost);
  d)Database port:3306;
All of this modification shoud be made in vars.json
2)PHP version >=5

I will get back with description about this application.

Thanks
